5/4 -- 2017: calls can now be hidden for the purpose of testing against
a resource. Option syntax: {hidden,[{resource_name,operation_name},...]}
will cause any operation at the specified resource to be ignored for the
purpose of checking that implementation calls match specification calls
(but the specification calls will still be issued).
See mergesort_tests.erl for a more complete usage example.

5/4 -- 2017: a new module shr_run for running a single test case on a system
(a resource specification, an implementation, a composite resource)
and observing the results.
