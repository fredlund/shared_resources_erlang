5/4 -- 2017: calls can now be hidden for the purpose of testing against
a resource. Option syntax: {hidden,[{resource_name,operation_name},...]}
will cause any operation at the specified resource to be ignored for the
purpose of checking that implementation calls match specification calls
(but the specification calls will still be issued).
See mergesort_tests.erl for a more complete usage example.

5/4 -- 2017: a new module shr_run for running a single test case on a system
(a resource specification, an implementation, a composite resource)
and observing the results.

1/4 -- 2017: shr_composite_resource permits defining a resource IMPLEMENTATION
as a composition of resources, possibly interconnected by trivial processes
which simply forwards messages from a resource to another.
See mergesorts_tests.erl for usage examples.

28/3 -- 2017: the new module shr_debug permits interacting with a resource
(or a composite resource) in an interactive manner, i.e., issuing calls to
a resource and observing whether the call blocked or not, and its return
value. See mergesort_tests.erl for usage examples.
