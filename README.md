# TESTING FRAMEWORK FOR SHARED RESOURCES JAVA IMPLEMENTATIONS # 

Framework for testing a class of safety-critical concurrent systems implemented using shared resource specifications. Shared resources contain declarative specifications of process interaction that can be used to derive, in a model-driven way, the most delicate parts of a concurrent system. For further information about shared resources, see [this page](http://babel.ls.fi.upm.es/~rnnalborodo/sr_web/).

Here, we propose their use to build a state-based model that will help in testing a real implementation of the resource. The framework has been implemented using Erlang and QuickCheck and it source code is available. The paper also provides a novel parametric operational semantics for shared resources with scheduling policy annotations and a methodology to guide test case generation from the shared resource specifications and a classification of common mis- takes. We illustrate our framework by applying it to testing Java implementations of a prototypical automate
