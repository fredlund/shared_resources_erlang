- Implement simulation mode; requires an example specific module for
generating a (simulation) call.

- Rewrite tester to use the group_commands Quickcheck style.

- Maybe separate priority checking, and messaging, from safety checking,
and messaging.

- Implement function return specification; a property in the
abstract specification and a concrete return value specification
in the implementation module (see eqc_statem_sim).
return_value it looks like.
