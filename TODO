- Implement simulation mode -- reuse the test generation code (command).
  There is also the implementation in Erlang (but this does not generate traffic).

- Think about thread example with priorities.

- We can easily generate a "generator" from a set of "trace executions".
Generator =
   run_traces	
   ([{enter, 0, weight()}, 
     {exit, 0, weight()},
     {enter, 1, weight()},
     ...
    ]++...)

The problem is the weights; weights must be monotonically increasing,
and the same exit and enter, but may increase between enter and exit.
How to specify this?

enter(Room,Weight) -> {enter,[Room,Weight]}
?LET(Weight,
