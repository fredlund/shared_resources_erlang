- To remove the risk of gc:s causing errors we should probably
rerun failing tests (non-progressing ones at least); that way we 
could also reduce the timeout and increase testing frequency.

- Maybe implement an option for ignoring safety errors to find scheduling
errors more reliably.

- Permit testing of multiple resources simultaneously.
